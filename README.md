# React + Vite

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react) uses **Babel** (or `esbuild` when used in rollup/vite) for Fast Refresh.
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh.

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled in this template because of its impact on dev & build performance.

To add it, see the official documentation.

---

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using **TypeScript** with type-aware lint rules enabled.

Check out the **TS template** for information on how to integrate TypeScript and `typescript-eslint` in your project.

# Day 2 – Small Homework

- Add another piece of state, e.g. `lastUpdated` string, and show it in the UI.
- Create a small `CurrentWeatherCard` component that receives:
  - `temperature`
  - `description`
  - `city`

  as props, and renders them (with mock values passed from `TodayPage`).
